        <h2>Rainfall & Water Sources</h2>
        <p>Kenya’s climate is marked by significant spatial and temporal variability in rainfall, which directly affects its water resources. Average annual precipitation dropped to 726.63 mm in 2024 from 1,050.32 mm in 2023 (tradingeconomics.com), with extreme regional disparities: Mandera County in the northeast receives as little as 2.5 mm annually, while Ololaimutiek in the southwest can experience up to 142 mm (climatecontroljournal.com). Kenya’s freshwater comes mainly from surface water—lakes, rivers, and reservoirs—with the Lake Victoria Basin supplying 59% of surface water and 54% of total renewable freshwater (dicf.unepgrid.ch). Groundwater is critical in arid and semi-arid regions, supporting both domestic and agricultural use, yet per capita water availability remains below 1,000 cubic meters annually, classifying Kenya as water-scarce (projectmaji.org).</p>
        <p>Despite these resources, Kenya faces numerous challenges. Uneven rainfall leads to recurrent droughts in the north and flooding in the west, disrupting water supply and agriculture. Rapid population growth and urbanization, especially in Nairobi and Mombasa, increase demand for clean water beyond sustainable limits. Pollution from industrial discharge, untreated sewage, and agricultural runoff contaminates rivers and lakes, reducing potable water quality. Overextraction of groundwater in arid regions has led to depletion and lowering of water tables, further stressing already scarce resources. These issues highlight the urgent need for integrated water management, conservation strategies, and infrastructure development to ensure sustainable access for all Kenyans.</p>

        <h2>Issues Caused by Rainfall Variability</h2>
        <p>Irregular rainfall patterns lead to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Droughts and Water Scarcity – Irregular rainfall leads to prolonged dry periods, reducing water availability for households, agriculture, and livestock, especially in arid and semi-arid regions.</li>
            <li>Flooding and Soil Erosion – Heavy, unpredictable rains cause floods, destroying crops, infrastructure, and settlements, and leading to significant soil erosion.</li>
            <li>Agricultural Instability – Unreliable rainfall disrupts planting and harvesting cycles, lowering crop yields and food security.</li>
            <li>Groundwater Depletion and Reduced Reservoir Levels – Insufficient rainfall fails to replenish rivers, lakes, and aquifers, putting pressure on water resources for domestic and industrial use.</li>
        </ul>
