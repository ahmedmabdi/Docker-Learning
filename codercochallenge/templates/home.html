        <h2>Rainfall & Water Sources</h2>

        <p>
            Kenya’s climate is highly variable in both space and time, creating significant challenges for water resource management. 
            Average annual precipitation fell sharply from <strong>1,050.32 mm in 2023</strong> to <strong>726.63 mm in 2024</strong> 
            (<a href="https://tradingeconomics.com" target="_blank">tradingeconomics.com</a>), with extreme regional disparities. 
            In the arid northeast, <strong>Mandera County</strong> receives as little as <strong>2.5 mm</strong> of rain annually, 
            while the humid southwest, such as <strong>Ololaimutiek</strong>, can record up to <strong>142 mm</strong> 
            (<a href="https://climatecontroljournal.com" target="_blank">climatecontroljournal.com</a>).
        </p>

        <p>
            Kenya’s freshwater comes mainly from surface water—lakes, rivers, and reservoirs—with the <strong>Lake Victoria Basin</strong> 
            supplying <strong>59%</strong> of surface water and <strong>54%</strong> of total renewable freshwater 
            (<a href="https://dicf.unepgrid.ch" target="_blank">dicf.unepgrid.ch</a>). 
            Groundwater is especially critical in arid and semi-arid regions, supporting both domestic and agricultural use. 
            However, per capita water availability remains below <strong>1,000 cubic meters annually</strong>, 
            classifying Kenya as <em>water-scarce</em> (<a href="https://projectmaji.org" target="_blank">projectmaji.org</a>).
        </p>

        <p>
            Despite these resources, Kenya faces numerous challenges:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Uneven rainfall leads to recurrent droughts in the north and flooding in the west, disrupting water supply and agriculture.</li>
            <li>Rapid population growth and urbanization, especially in <strong>Nairobi</strong> and <strong>Mombasa</strong>, are increasing demand for clean water beyond sustainable limits.</li>
            <li>Pollution from industrial discharge, untreated sewage, and agricultural runoff contaminates rivers and lakes, reducing potable water quality.</li>
            <li>Overextraction of groundwater in arid regions has caused depletion and lowering of water tables, further stressing already scarce resources.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These issues highlight the urgent need for integrated water management, conservation strategies, and infrastructure development to ensure sustainable access for all Kenyans.

        <h2>Issues Caused by Rainfall Variability</h2>
        <p>Irregular rainfall patterns lead to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Droughts and Water Scarcity – Irregular rainfall leads to prolonged dry periods, reducing water availability for households, agriculture, and livestock, especially in arid and semi-arid regions.</li>
            <li>Flooding and Soil Erosion – Heavy, unpredictable rains cause floods, destroying crops, infrastructure, and settlements, and leading to significant soil erosion.</li>
            <li>Agricultural Instability – Unreliable rainfall disrupts planting and harvesting cycles, lowering crop yields and food security.</li>
            <li>Groundwater Depletion and Reduced Reservoir Levels – Insufficient rainfall fails to replenish rivers, lakes, and aquifers, putting pressure on water resources for domestic and industrial use.</li>
        </ul>
