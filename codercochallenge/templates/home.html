        <h2>Rainfall & Water Sources</h2>
        <p>Kenya experiences highly variable rainfall across different regions. The country has two main rainy seasons: the Long Rains (March-May) and Short Rains (October-December). Average rainfall varies significantly from 250 mm/year in arid areas to over 2,000 mm/year in highland regions.</p>
        <p>Main water sources include rivers, lakes, dams, and underground aquifers. However, these are unevenly distributed, often leaving arid and semi-arid regions with scarce access.</p>

        <h2>Issues Caused by Rainfall Variability</h2>
        <p>Irregular rainfall patterns lead to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Droughts affecting over 3 million people annually in northern and eastern Kenya.</li>
            <li>Flooding during heavy rains, causing displacement and destruction of infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Reduced agricultural productivity, threatening food security.</li>
            <li>Contamination of water sources, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases.</li>
        </ul>
